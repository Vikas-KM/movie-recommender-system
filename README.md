> Content Based Movie Recommender System Machine Learning Model using cosine similarity

**Demo App** - [Movie Recommender System](https://vikaskm-movie-recommender.herokuapp.com/)

## About Project
In this recommender system model we use cosine similarity to get the movies which are similar to the given movie.

### What is cosine similarity
Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. It is measured by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. It is often used to measure document similarity in text analysis.
